# hticketiser

From YAML to Jira tickets. 

---

This is a reimplementation in Haskell of _the ticketiser_ I have been using at work for close to two years. That version is written in Python and it was a bit too complex to generalise. This one is not easy, but at least having a compiled language means tinkering with it to make it work is a bit less sensitive.

You can read a [blog post about my experience using Haskell to write this project](https://mostlymaths.net/2020/08/the-ticketiser-2-now-in-haskell.html/), since this is the first time I have written anything of any non-trivial size.

## Usage

Write a `tickets.yaml` file like

```yaml
- epic: Title goes here
  us: User story goes here, needs to be PROPERLY formatted
  ac: Acceptance criteria
- story: Title goes here
  us: You know the drill
  ac: All done
- story: There are some optional fields
  us: Like
  ac: Description as above
  desc: Or points, which should be a number
  pt: 34
```

_Note_: User stories are expected in the format

```
As a(n) _, I want to _ so that _
```

This is enforced by the parser in [Story.hs](src/Story.hs) (used in [Tickets.hs](src/Tickets.hs)). Note that this processing is done via parser combinators, which is neither the most efficient nor the easiest way of doing it. I wanted to use PCs in a later project and since this is an easy place, why not. This is so stories can be rewritten with new lines, they look better. I recommend you set up some macro/snippet in your editor so you can create stories following this template by default, then you have all the power of machines to make sure you do everything the right way.

Set up a file `~/.hticketiser.yaml` with

```yaml
path: https://yourjiracloudpath.atlassian.net
auth: as seen in Jira docs at [1]
```

[1] https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/#getting-your-api-token

_Note_: The easiest way to get the properly encoded login token is to get an API token, use the `curl` example in the page linked above with the `-v` (verbose) flag. It will give you the properly encoded token for the API request without you needing to mess with the encodings.

Run 

```bash
hticketiser tickets.yaml
```

Profit of your time savings.

_Note_: By default this will go to project `11400` and team `12401`. You will need to tweak this unless you work on _my_ team and company.

_Additional note_: Stories after an epic go to the last-seen epic, starting from the top. Thus, you can chain creating several epics and the stories that go inside of each without any additional effort. If you want stories _outside_ of epics, put them on top of the file.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rberenguel/hticketiser
cd hticketiser
stack build  # Wait for a bit (â€¦)
stack install
```

## FAQ/Problems you may encounter

#### Each Jira cloud is an island

Each Jira is set up differently. This means the mappings from field identifiers to API payloads (in [Jira.hs](src/Jira.hs) and [Tickets.hs](src/Tickets.hs)) need to be tweaked for your specific use case. There are some details in those files, but the summary is:

- Visit `https://yourjiracloudpath.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/ISSUE IDENTIFIER`
- Modify `JiraMap` in `Jira.hs` to have the fields your Jira set up requires
- Tweak as needed in `Tickets.hs` to make sure the payloads are properly created
- Stack install and try as many times as needed.

It takes a while, the first time I had to do this I spent the best part of an afternoon cursing at Jira and figuring this out.

#### I hate Haskell

Well, if you can read it you can figure out how this works and reimplement it in your language of choice. It's a good beginner exercise for any language.

#### Why did you use YAML and not [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org)?

ðŸ˜’

#### Why not just ignore Jira?

Well, planning projects requires writing tickets. In particular, there are some kind of tickets product owners can't write. The very technical in particular, and if I need to write them, I want to avoid as much as possible having to click in 25 different places and wait for a not-very-fast-API.

#### What is this [Stan](stan.html) file?

I have started using [Stan](https://github.com/kowainik/stan) after a suggestion from Reddit when I shared my project there (I got a lot of useful suggestions and I will try to implement/use them all as time allows). It is a static code analyzer that suggests safety/performance improvements, seems very slick so far.
